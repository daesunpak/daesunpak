      <h3 class="heading-23">Understanding How to Use Real Estate Videos</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-12">The secret that most successful Realtors know is that the playing field is not level when it comes to Realtor.com, Zillow, Trulia and others listing sites.<br><br>For example, Realtor.com accepts Video Virtual Tours and places a &quot;VR Tour&quot; icon on top of the first image on the listing&#x27;s webpage. Zillow and Trulia, do not accept Video Virtual Tours and Realtor.com does not provide an icon indicating that the listing has a walkthrough video or other professional video. As a matter of fact, Realtor.com does not even show walkthrough or professional videos on their website.<br><br>However, savvy Realtors know that placing their videos along side their Video Virtual Tours on the VR Tour link solves that problem. <strong>Snap2Close </strong>is the <strong>only</strong> company that provides that solution in the greater Phoenix area.<br><br>Conversely, Zillow and Trulia do not allow Realtors to use virtual tours on their websites, yet they will display an icon for a walkthroughs video or other professional video. Zillow displays an  icon on the first photo and Trulia simply displays a  icon on listings with a video.<br><br>Zillow, which also owns Trulia, allow Realtors and Zillow Certified Photographers to record a 2 minute video using their Zillow Mobile App. While these videos are proven to create many more listing clicks (potential home buyers clicking on the listing) they can also be very boring because they do not include any background music, graphics, titles, or professional editing.<br><br>To better learn about the typical quality of a Zillow Walkthrough Video then simply visit their website at <a href="https://www.zillow.com/" target="_new">Zillow.com</a> and look at several of their videos. Most of these are done by Realtors who do not use any type of stabilization equipmemt and the resulting videos can be pretty jerky and difficult to watch.<strong><br></strong></p>

          <p class="paragraph-16">The <strong>Pro Video Home Tour</strong> is a totally different type of video and is recorded with a very high quality Canon 5D Mark IV full sensor camera and utilizes a DJI Ronin-M stabilizer which provides smooth pan and tilt video clips. Pro-Video Tours are typically shorter in length than our Enhanced Video Walkthroughs, but are more entertaining and enticing to potential home buyers. Our <strong>Pro Video Home Tours </strong>are professionally edited using Adobe&#x27;s Premiere Pro and After Effects software, and include motion graphics, and background music.<br><br>The <strong>Snap2Close Pro Video Home Tour </strong>is also compatible with all MLS systems and can viewed on Realtor.com as a part of a video virtual tour and can be used on any custom webpage a listing may have and can be posted on Facebook and other social media sites. Additionally, Pro Video Home Tours are automatically uploaded to Zillow thereby putting your listing at or near the top of the search results.</p>

      <h1 class="heading-28">360 Degree Panorama Tours<br></h1>
      <p>360 Panoramas are becoming very popular again with Realtors as an <strong>affordable alternative </strong>to Matterport 3D Tours. This is in part to the higher quality 360 cameras, which are also becoming popular with the general population. While we are not yet to the point were potential home buyers are expecting it, it is becoming a sought after feature to help them explore the listed property. Just think about it, do 360-degree views of rooms help your customer make a more informed buying decision? The answer is obviously yes. If a photo says a thousand words, then a 360 photo is the whole book. There is no better way to visualize the internal area of any real estate than with 360 photos. Snap2Close now offers 360 Panorama Tours. Our website will have samples for you to view within the next two weeks.<br></p>
      <h1 class="heading-29">State-of-the-Art Matterport® PRO 3D Virtual Tours<br></h1>
      <p>While 360 Panorama Tours can clearly show each and every room of your listing, the Matterport 3D Virtual Tour is a way to take the potential buyer to the next level. On average, potential buys spend three times more time viewing a listing with immersive 3D tours than listings with photos alone. Plus, showing your new potential listing client that your professional marketing efforts includes three dimensional virtual tours is a way to set yourself apart from other agents. So if a picture is a worth a thousand words, the best way to explain the Matterport 3D Tour is to demonstrate it. Click the &quot;Play&quot; button (triangle) in the center of the Matterport Tour below to start. When the tour starts, the lower left-hand corner of the screen will contain a series of icons. The walking symbol takes you to the virtual 3D walkthrough (default). There are also icons for &#x27;Dollhouse View&#x27; and a photo-realistic top-down floorplan.<br></p>
