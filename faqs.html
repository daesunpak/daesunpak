          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item-content">
            <p class="accordion-item-content">Snap2Close only performs professional real estate photography services. Unlike many competitors, this is not a side business. We do not install signposts, hang lock boxes, photographs weddings or events, etc. We are 100% dedicated to Professional Real Estate Photography and only used highly trained and professional photographers and FAA licensed (UAV) drone pilots.<br><br>Also, unlike many competitors who send their images overseas to be processed, our in-house proprietary system processing ensures the highest quality listing photos.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-42">Why choose Snap2Close Photography?</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item-content">
            <p class="accordion-item-content">We believe that we have the best pricing plans available in the real estate photography market and we encourage you to compare our pricing and quality of work with our competitors. But that is the quick answer. Basically we believe that this is really a five part answer.We use the highest quality camera equipment in the Real Estate Photography industry. The quality of the cameras and lenses is where it all starts!!<br><br>1. We only provide you with mature trained professional photographers. (Note: Several of our competitors hire young people off the street with no experience and with a starting pay as little as $15 per hour.)<br><br>2. We take the time to properly photograph your listing. Most of our competitors try to be in and out within 40 minutes. We believe that it takes time to properly light and photograph each room. Depending on the size of the listing we may be on-site from 1 to 3 hours.<br><br>3. We process all photos in-house using our proprietary image blending system.<br><br>4. We provide you with an unsurpassed quality Client Center and Dashboard with numerous visual marketing tools like a PDF Flyer Generator, branded and MLS-Compliant custom sites and video virtual tours.</p>

          <div class="accordion-item-content">
            <p class="accordion-item-content">There’s no need for you to be there, but you are certainly invited to come and watch out our process. We think it’s pretty cool and you and your clients might be intrigued as well! Being at the listing would also give you an opportunity to show the photographer any specific shots you might have in mind. Otherwise we’ll use our best professional judgment and will take the photographs that best market the property.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item-content">
            <p class="accordion-item-content">We rely on the agent and/or homeowner to stage and prepare the property prior to the photographer&#x27;s arrival. Our photographers have an allotted amount of time onsite to photograph the property. They might have time to do small staging tasks like moving Kleenex boxes or soap from counters, but it is always appreciated when this done ahead of time so the photographer has plenty of time to get all of the needed shots onsite.</p>

            <p class="accordion-item-content">If there is perspiration in the air (or we are in the midst of a dust storm), we leave it up to your discretion to reschedule. If you do not call or email us to reschedule the appointment, we assume we are still photographing the property listing&#x27;s interior rooms. The $45 Inclement Weather Return Fee is only charged if you want us to come back at another scheduled time to shoot the exteriors. The fee covers the gas and time for the photographer to come back to your property.<br><br>Snap2Close does not shoot exterior photographs in the rain or during dust storms. The primary reason is that our professional cameras and special lenses are very expensive and we do not want to expose them to unnecessary moisture or dust. Secondly, our photographers take multiple time exposures for each shot and then blends the exposures together into one high quality high dynamic range (HDR) image. Blending moving raindrops or blowing dust can create blurred images.</p>

          <div class="accordion-item-content">
            <p class="accordion-item-content">Uploading to MLS is probably one of the easiest yet unfamiliar aspects of being in Real Estate. It allows you to go and tweak your listing however you want, and it usually takes a total of 3 minutes. Here are the steps:<br><br>(Note: This help only refers to the ARMLS system, other MLS systems may vary).<br><br>1. From your listing click on the &quot;Photos&quot; link under the &quot;Multimedia&quot; section.<br><br>2. On the next window click &quot;add photos&quot; and window to browse for your photos will open.<br><br>3. Find the location where you saved the images after downloading them. Once you open that folder, select the images and click the button at the bottom to add them. They will then show in the &quot;Upload Photos&quot; window above. Click the &quot;Start Upload&quot; button.<br><br>4. To drag and drop, open the folder that contains the images that you downloaded earlier. Select the images you want to add to the MLS (Use Ctrl A on your PC or Cmd A on your Mac to select all the images). Then use your mouse to drag the photos over to the photos window and drop them. The upload will start automatically.</p>

            <p class="accordion-item-content">If they are separate listings because they are separate units, we consider those two separate shoots. We do this simply because we have to do twice the work for one cost. Two addresses = two custom Dashboards, two properties with separate images, two sets slideshows, etc. We hope you understand.<br></p>

          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item-content">
            <p class="accordion-item-content">It depends. Because information has to be “re-drawn” wherever the Photoshopping takes place, it is determined on a case by case basis. For instance, vehicles are extremely difficult to remove from photos, due to the amount of information that needs to be re-drawn in its place.<br><br>It should also be said that when it comes to MLS regulations, we are unable to fix any structural problems with the property. This includes removing telephone poles, power lines, or cell towers.<br><br>For portfolio images, we can fix whatever you need us to since those images are not selling an individual property, but selling a service or brand. There is a $30 per hour fee for this type of additional work.</p>
